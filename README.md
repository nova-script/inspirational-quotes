# Inspirational Quotes

Inspirational quotes is a website where you can store your favorite quotes.

It's under development, but it's working perfectly right now.

## Objective:

It was developed to accomplish a code challenge made by [Woovi](https://woovi.com/), due to a selective process for a developer vacancy at the company.

They asked the participants to build a simple CRUD using `GraphQL` and `Relay`.

Additionally, there's a list of technologies the company uses (tech stack) which I'm trying to implement as much as possible.
